### Dreams to Reality

Our dream is to allow people the opportunity to use their gifts and talents to create, develop, and provide for their families and community. You cannot love someone if you strip them of their dignity. Our passion is giving people hope by offering zero interest loans in villages where no bank would go. We do this through a simple but careful process. All of the money will be handled through Ben's brother Raymond who is a college graduate and a strong Christian. He will receive requests for loans generally from groups of four or more men or women in his village.  When someone makes the decision to share their wealth with a brother or sister in Kenya, Ben's brother along with a respected leader of the village will meet with the recipient once a month. In Kenya it is crucial that the leaders are given important roles to play both ensuring accountability for the loan and respect for the traditional leaders. It is our mission to give people the ability to use their gifts not to become rich but to develop, nurture, dream and continue the mission of making disciples of all nations. Thanks to your gifts dreams are alive and hope is rampant!

### The Progress

Ben has been sending money back to his village since he first got to America in 2007. In 2008 the first loan was sent to Kenya with an agreement that the money would be paid back within a year. The money was used to buy chicks which would be raised and used to sell eggs. Before a year was even up the money was sent back with appreciation and gratitude. This past summer Ben and I went to Kenya for three weeks. We gave out a couple loans including $225 to a young man seen in the video who had dropped out of school to take care of his two younger brother when his mother and father both past away. He had been struggling to pay off the medical bills his parents had taken out while keeping his farm and his too younger brothers in school. He had been dreaming of starting a small chicken farm and had begin to build a coup with old wire he had found and scrap wood. We were able to help him finish building the coup with good materials and buy chickens.  The young man who is also named ben said that we must have been from God because he knows his prayers are now answered. So far this year beginning in June $2,000 were lent out and $1,500 has already been payed back.
