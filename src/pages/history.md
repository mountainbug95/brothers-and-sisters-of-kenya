### How it Began

The dream began in 2008 when two college students Ben (who is currently a division one track athlete and can not have his full name associated with any kind of fund raising) and Bryan Upshaw met at Milligan College, in upper East Tennessee.  Ben was a cross country runner from Kenya and Bryan was a business major eager to find ways to use business to help create sustainable work for the poor. Though Ben had virtually nothing to his name and was taking out loans to pay for school, he still found ways to send clothes and money back to his village in order to help a number of young men from his village start a chicken business. Bryan decided that if Ben who was just learning how to use a computer could make such a difference surely other Christians could come along side and help create work for the poor in Kenya.  Bryan decided to send one hundred dollars to help with the chicken business and see if the recipients would be responsible in returning the loan. Amazingly a year later the money was wired back. The young men had bought small chicks and had successfully been growing them while selling eggs with the chickens that were already grown. It was running that allowed Ben to escape poverty and come to America. However, he has chosen to never run away from poverty and has instead inspired others to share their resources with the talented and hard working poor in his village.
