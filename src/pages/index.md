  text: We at Brothers and Sisters in Kenya are a Christian network passionate about
    sharing opportunities with the poor in Kenya. We do this through giving zero interest
    loans to a small village near Elburgon, Kenya. The village called Kiptet Farm
    is located in Central West Kenya 130 miles north west of Nairobi. In 2007 a young
    18 year old teenager made it to America running cross country. Ben never forgot
    his friends and family back home and vowed to send aid back even though he did
    not even have enough to pay for college. His story inspired others to pitch in
    and we are now in the building phase of giving orphaned teenagers, the working
    poor, and jobless people an opportunity to use their gifts and talents to have
    meaningful work. The loans allow credit to those whom traditional banks would
    never give to. While we are currently merely a network of caring people, our plan
    is to become an NGO.
