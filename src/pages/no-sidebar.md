### Where does the money go?

While our dream is to become an NGO by the end of 2014, we are currently just a network of people trying to share what we have with our brothers and sisters across the ocean. Checks can be made out to **Bryan Upshaw / 478 Oak Forest Pl / Kingsport, TN 37664**. Or you can donate money to Bryan's account using Paypal bellow.  Generally money is collected until there is around $500 and then it is wired to an account in Kenya where Ben's brother, Raymond, has access to withdraw money to give loans and make deposits as loans are paid back. 100% of the money goes to the small loans unless you would like to make a note and help pay for the legal fees to become an NGO.  Just a $100 - $200 carries the potential to change the lives of a family forever. School and medicine become affordable, families are able to give,  some will save up to pursue a new dream.  All recipients will go through a Bible study each month that will teach them how they can be a blessing with their new work and new resources to help build the church and the local community.  Our goal is not to create material wealth but to give dignity, confidence, and hope to those who face the desperate struggles of being born into poverty.
